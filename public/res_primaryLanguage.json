      "description": "My name is Rob Ball and I am a software developer with a primary focus in Javascript and front-end development. Prior to beginning my career transition into tech, I served for 9 years as an Infantry Officer in the Army where I continuously led teams to accomplish ambitious goals. My interest in software development was sparked by my passion for building efficiencies and problem solving. I found that coding was a great way to combine those two passions while creating functional applications. In addition to software development, I am also expanding my skill set into Cyber Operations. I am a lifelong learner and am always looking forward to new technologies on the horizon.",
